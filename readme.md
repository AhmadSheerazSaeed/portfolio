## Project Use

Anyone can clone the project and use it according to his/her needs.

## Layout in Figma file

I have made this file at the start of the project but as the project continues, the layout has been changed and now i am changing the project not the figma file because i will change the project in the future also and may include many new things.

## Colors

I have chosen the Black, White and Crimson color scheme. I have used crimson to attract the user's attention on some particular words and sections.

## Hero Section

On top left i have my name as a logo and top right i have the menu. In mobile and tablet view, there is a animated icon. Which is a .svg file and i was learning about .svg animation and animate it using id's, which i had created in Figma.
